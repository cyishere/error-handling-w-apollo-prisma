This is the "starter repo" for the "Error Handling with Apollo & Prisma" blog post.

In the `server/` fold, the server already has some error handling with Apollo Server.

In the `client/` it only has the basic UI.

For running the server and client, please install the dependencies first.

- [README on client](./client/README.md)
